# BaseProject - Claude Code Template

A comprehensive project template with built-in Claude Code workflows, best practices, and extensive documentation for rapid development setup.

**What you get:** Git hooks • Multi-language support • Security defaults • 18 comprehensive guides • Claude-optimized workflows

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Option 1: New Project Setup

**Copy this prompt into Claude Code:**
```
I want to create a new project from the BaseProject template. Follow this workflow:

1. First, ask me for: project name, description, tech stack (Python/JS/Go), and what API keys I'll need
2. Clone https://github.com/AutumnsGrove/BaseProject (main branch) to /tmp
3. Copy to ~/Projects/[PROJECT_NAME] (exclude .git/)
4. Customize AGENT.md with my project details (Purpose, Tech Stack, Architecture)
5. Update README.md with project-specific info (title, description, features)
6. Init language dependencies (uv init for Python, npm init for JS, go mod init for Go)
7. Create directory structure: src/ and tests/ with proper init files for the chosen language
8. Generate secrets_template.json with my API key placeholders
9. Create TODOS.md with 3-5 starter tasks based on the project description
10. Run git init using global git config (user.name and user.email)
11. Ask if I want to install git hooks (recommended: yes, auto-detects language from files created in step 6)
12. If yes, run ./ClaudeUsage/pre_commit_hooks/install_hooks.sh
13. Make initial commit: "feat: initialize [PROJECT] from BaseProject template"
14. Display project summary and next steps including reminder about installed hooks

Start by asking me for the project details.
```

Claude will interactively:
- Ask for project name, tech stack, and requirements
- Copy BaseProject template to your chosen location
- Customize AGENT.md with your project details
- Set up language-specific dependencies (pyproject.toml, package.json, etc.)
- Create proper project structure (src/, tests/)
- Generate secrets_template.json with your needed API keys
- Initialize git with proper configuration
- **Install git hooks (recommended)** - auto-detects your language and installs:
  - Code quality checks (Black/Ruff for Python, Prettier/ESLint for JS, gofmt for Go)
  - Security scanner (prevents committing API keys/secrets)
  - Test runner (blocks push if tests fail)
  - Dependency auto-updater (runs on branch switch)
- Create initial commit following our standards

---

### Option 2: Add to Existing Project

**Copy this prompt into Claude Code (run in your project directory):**

```
I want to add BaseProject structure to my CURRENT project. Follow this workflow:

1. Analyze my existing project: read README.md, AGENT.md, git history for commit patterns, detect tech stack and package managers, identify architecture (monorepo/single/etc), read TODOS.md if exists
2. Clone https://github.com/AutumnsGrove/BaseProject (main branch) to /tmp/bp
3. Copy ClaudeUsage/ to my project (preserve any existing ClaudeUsage/ files, only add new guides)
4. Intelligently merge AGENT.md: if exists, parse sections and merge BaseProject sections using markers like "<!-- BaseProject: Git Workflow -->". If doesn't exist, create from template with detected project details
5. Enhance .gitignore by merging entries (preserve existing, add missing from BaseProject)
6. Analyze commit messages and suggest adopting BaseProject conventional commit style if inconsistent
7. Check if using branches like dev/main and suggest workflow if not
8. Ask if I want to install git hooks (they auto-detect my language and back up existing hooks first)
9. If yes, run ./ClaudeUsage/pre_commit_hooks/install_hooks.sh interactively
10. Generate/update TODOS.md with project-aware tasks
11. Create integration-summary.md report showing what was added/merged/skipped
12. Backup all modified files to ./.baseproject-backup-[TIMESTAMP]/
13. Cleanup /tmp/bp
14. Display next steps

Start by analyzing my current project.
```

Claude will intelligently:
- Analyze your existing project structure and conventions
- Detect tech stack from package files (package.json, pyproject.toml, etc.)
- Copy ClaudeUsage/ guides without overwriting existing files
- Merge AGENT.md sections with clear markers (preserves your content)
- Append missing .gitignore entries without removing existing ones
- Compare your commit style to BaseProject standards and offer suggestions
- **Optionally install git hooks** - backs up existing hooks, auto-detects language, installs appropriate quality/security hooks
- Create backup of all modified files before making changes
- Generate integration-summary.md showing exactly what was changed
- Respect your existing README.md (won't overwrite)
- Adapt to your project's existing structure

## 🏠 House Agents Integration

This template works seamlessly with [house-agents](https://github.com/houseworthe/house-agents) - specialized Claude Code sub-agents that keep your context clean.

### What Are House Agents?

Specialized sub-agents that run heavy operations in separate context windows:
- **house-research** - Search 70k+ tokens across files, return 3k summary (95% savings)
- **house-git** - Analyze 43k token diffs, return 500 token summary (98% savings)
- **house-bash** - Process 21k+ command output, return 700 token summary (97% savings)

### Quick Install

**Project-Level (this project only):**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/houseworthe/house-agents.git /tmp/house-agents
cp -r /tmp/house-agents/.claude .
```

**User-Wide (all projects):**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/houseworthe/house-agents.git /tmp/house-agents
mkdir -p ~/.claude/agents
cp /tmp/house-agents/.claude/agents/*.md ~/.claude/agents/
```

**Test Installation:**
```
Use house-research to find all TODO comments in the codebase
```

See [ClaudeUsage/house_agents.md](ClaudeUsage/house_agents.md) for usage patterns and examples.

## 🛠️ Customization Workflow

After running setup:

1. **Edit AGENT.md** - Fill in your project specifics
   - Project purpose
   - Tech stack
   - Architecture notes

2. **Create secrets files** (if needed)
   ```bash
   # For Python projects
   cp ClaudeUsage/templates/secrets_template.json secrets_template.json
   cp secrets_template.json secrets.json
   # Edit secrets.json with real API keys
   ```

3. **Set up dependencies**
   ```bash
   # Python with UV
   uv init

   # JavaScript/Node
   npm init -y

   # Go
   go mod init yourproject
   ```

4. **Install git hooks** (recommended)
   ```bash
   # Interactive installer (auto-detects your language)
   ./ClaudeUsage/pre_commit_hooks/install_hooks.sh

   # This installs:
   # - Code quality checks (formatters + linters)
   # - Security scanner (prevents API key leaks)
   # - Test runner (blocks push if tests fail)
   # - Dependency auto-updater
   ```

5. **Update TODOS.md** - Add your specific tasks

# 1. Check TODOS.md
# 2. Use Context7 to fetch JWT library docs
# 3. Implement following your git commit standards
# 4. Update TODOS.md
# 5. Commit with proper message format
```
